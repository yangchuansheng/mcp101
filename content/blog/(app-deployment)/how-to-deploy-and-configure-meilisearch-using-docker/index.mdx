While Elasticsearch might offer broader functionality and a larger ecosystem, and Algolia excels in its cloud offering and out-of-the-box experience, **Meilisearch uniquely shines in speed, ease of use, and open-source friendliness.** It strikes a perfect balance, especially for small to medium-sized projects and teams wanting full control over their search infrastructure.

## Installing and Configuring Meilisearch

Meilisearch is relatively simple to install and use, offering various installation methods to suit different environments and needs.

Even if you don't have a technical background, you don't need to worry about installation. The [Sealos App Store](https://template.sealos.io) provides a one-click deployment template â€“ just click your mouse, and you're done. It's incredibly smooth.

**If you want to quickly deploy Meilisearch without getting bogged down in tedious installation and configuration**, give Sealos a try.

Open the Meilisearch application template directly:

<DeployButton deployUrl="https://template.sealos.io/deploy?templateName=meilisearch" />

Then, click "Deploy on Sealos" in the top right corner.

> If this is your first time using [Sealos](https://sealos.io/), you'll need to register and log in to your Sealos public cloud account. After logging in, you'll be immediately redirected to the template deployment page.

There are two crucial environment variables to pay special attention to here. Configuring these correctly ensures the security and performance of your Meilisearch instance.

1.  **`MEILI_ENV`**: Sets the instance environment. It can only be **`production`** or **`development`**.
    -   `production` mode: Disables the search preview interface for security.
    -   `development` mode: Enables the search preview interface.

2.  **`MEILI_MASTER_KEY`**: Sets the master key for Meilisearch, which automatically protects all routes except `GET /health`. Other endpoints, including the search preview interface, can only be accessed using an API key derived from this master key.
    -   In `production` mode:
        -   Providing a master key is **mandatory**.
        -   If no master key is provided, or if it's less than 16 bytes long, Meilisearch will throw an error and refuse to start.
    -   In `development` mode:
        -   Providing a master key is **optional**.
        -   If no master key is provided, all routes are unprotected and publicly accessible.

Regardless of the mode, if you don't provide a master key or if the provided key is less than 16 bytes, Meilisearch will suggest using an automatically generated one.

**In summary: A master key is required for `production` mode; it's optional for `development` mode.**

Generating a key is very simple. Just execute the following command in a Linux or macOS terminal to generate a random key:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

After filling in the parameters, click "Deploy App" in the top right corner to start the deployment.

Once deployment is complete, click the application's "Details" to go to its details page.

![Meilisearch application details page on Sealos](./images/details-of-meilisearch-on-sealos.png)

Wait for the application status to become `running`, then click the "Public Address" to open the Meilisearch search preview dashboard.

When you open it, it looks like this. Enter the master key you set to gain access.

## Basic Meilisearch Usage

Meilisearch provides an intuitive RESTful API, making integration with various programming languages and frameworks straightforward. Here are some basic operation examples using `curl`:

### Create an Index

An index is where your documents (data records) are stored.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MASTER_KEY' \
  --data-binary '{
    "uid": "movies",
    "primaryKey": "id"
  }'
```
*(Replace `YOUR_MASTER_KEY` with your actual key, or an appropriate API key)*

### Add Documents

Add some data to your newly created index.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/documents' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MASTER_KEY' \
  --data-binary '[
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Carol",
      "genres": ["Romance", "Drama"]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Wonder Woman",
      "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"]
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Little Women",
      "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"]
    }
  ]'
```

### Search Documents

Perform a search query on your indexed data.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MASTER_KEY' \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "wonder"
  }'
```
*(This will likely return the "Wonder Woman" document)*

## Integrating Meilisearch into a Flarum Forum

To showcase Meilisearch's power in a real-world application, we'll use the Flarum forum software as an example, demonstrating how to integrate Meilisearch to enhance its search capabilities.

> For instructions on installing and using Flarum, refer to our previous article: [Flarum Installation and Usage Tutorial](./how-to-deploy-and-configure-flarum-using-docker)

### Install the Meilisearch PHP SDK

In the Flarum application details interface on Sealos, click the terminal button in the bottom right corner:

![Opening the terminal for the Flarum application within the Sealos](./images/open-meilisearch-terminal-on-sealos.png)

In the opened terminal, execute the following command to install the Meilisearch PHP SDK (assuming Flarum uses Composer and extensions are managed this way):

```bash
extension require meilisearch/meilisearch-php
```

### Install the Scout Search Extension for Flarum

Similarly, in the Flarum container terminal, execute the following command to install the Scout Search extension (which bridges Laravel Scout functionality, often used for search integration, into Flarum):

```bash
extension require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-scout
```

### Enable the Scout Extension

In the Flarum administration panel, enable the `Scout` extension. Then, configure it to use "Meilisearch" as the search engine. You can optionally specify an index name (e.g., `flarum_posts`); if left blank, it might use a default.

![Flarum admin panel showing the extensions list, highlighting the Scout extension](./images/flarum-admin-panel.png)

Next, you need to configure the Meilisearch URL (Host) and API Key.

![Scout extension settings within Flarum admin, showing fields for Meilisearch Host and Key](./images/scout-extension-on-flarum.png)

If your Meilisearch and Flarum instances are deployed in the same Sealos availability zone (or namespace), you can use Meilisearch's internal network address. Go to the Meilisearch application details page on Sealos, click the "Private Address" to copy it, and paste this value into the "Meilisearch Host" field in the Scout plugin settings. Use the `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` you set during deployment for the API Key field.

### Increase Meilisearch Memory Allocation

Meilisearch deployed via the default Sealos template might only have 128MB of memory allocated. This is often insufficient when integrating with an application like Flarum. It's recommended to increase this to at least 1GB. Here's how:

Go to the Meilisearch application details page on Sealos and click "Update" in the top right corner:

![Meilisearch application details page on Sealos](./images/update-meilisearch-on-sealos.png)

Adjust the memory allocation to 1G (1 Gigabyte), then click "Update" to apply the changes.

![Sealos Dashboard for changing resource allocations, setting Meilisearch memory to 1G](./images/change-meilisearch-mem-on-sealos.png)

### Import Flarum Data into Meilisearch Index

Use the following command within the Flarum terminal to import your existing forum data (posts, discussions, users, etc.) into the Meilisearch index managed by Scout:

```bash
php flarum scout:import-all
```

A successful import will look something like this in the terminal output:

![Terminal output showing the successful completion of the 'php flarum scout:import-all' command](./images/import-flarum-index-to-meilisearch.png)

Finally, let's test the search functionality (the screenshot shows a Chinese search, demonstrating multi-language capability):
